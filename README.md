# BashUtils
Just a set of utilities that are executed in bash.

# Intalling
1. Choose the bash file (make sure is available in your OS)
2. Download the file and execute this command: `sudo chmod +x /path/to/bash`
3. Just execute the file :smile:

# Available OS
To make this easier every bash file will be stored in the available OS, for example, for macs will be stored in `/macOS`
